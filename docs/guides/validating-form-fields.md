# Validating Form Fields

AMPATH Forms enables you to add arbitrarily complex validation to your form inputs. Broadly, three approaches for validating inputs are possible using AMPATH Forms:

- Date-based validation
- Validation based on JavaScript expressions
- Validation based on Conditional answers

## Date-based validation

This type of validation enforces certain conditions for [date](/advanced-topics/fields-reference#date) inputs. You can use date-based validation to guarantee that a Date input only allows:

- Past or present dates
- Past, present or future dates

## Validation based on JavaScript expressions
